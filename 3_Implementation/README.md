 ## UASGE OF SWITCH CASE/IF ELSE/ELSE IF
 -------
 ## Preprocessor:
 The C preprocessor is a macro processor thet is used automatically by the C complier to transform your program before actual compilation. it is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are breif abbreviations for longer constructs.
 ## The C preprocessor provides four separate facilities that you can use as you see fit:
 Inclusion of header files.These are files of declarations that can be substituted into your program. Macro expression. you can define macros,which are abbreviations or arbitraty ragments of C code, and then the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions throught the program. Conditional compilation. Using special preprocessing directives,you can include or exclude parts of the program according to various conditions. Line control. if you use a program to combine or rearrange the source files into an intermediate file which is complied, you can use line control to inorm the complier of where each source line originally came from.
 ## Switch case:
 * A switch case statement allows a variable to be tested for quality against a list o values.Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.
 # syntax
 switch(expression)
 {case value-1:Block-1;Break;case value-2:Block-2;Break;case value-n:Block-n;Break;default:Block-1;Break;}
 ## IF ELSE:
 .the if else statement in c is used to perform the operations based on some specific condition. The operations speciied in if block are excuted if and only if the given condition is true.
